                Australia beat India by six wickets at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad to lift the 2023 ODI World Cup trophy. The Aussies won a record-extending sixth title, after having won the 1987, 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2015 editions.
                
                
                Opener Travis Head led the charge with a 120-ball 137 as Australia chased down a 241-run target in 43 overs to beat India in an ODI World Cup final for the second time. Ricky Ponting’s Autralian team had beaten Sourav Ganguly’s team back in 2003 in Johannesburg.
                
                India had reached the final on the back of a 10-match winning streak and had beaten Australia in the league-stage match in Chennai last month. Australia, on the other hand, suffered two back-to-back defeats in its first two games but bounced back to win nine consecutive matches, including the final, to secure the title.

              <p>England won their first-ever 50-over World Cup at the 2019 rain-marred edition, this becoming the third straight team to win the ultimate glory on its home soil. The 2019 Cricket World Cup, hosted by England and Wales, provided an unforgettable spectacle filled with amazing moments, exceptional performances, and dramatic twists.
                The 2019 Cricket World Cup Final was a One Day International cricket match played at Lord's in London, England, on 14 July 2019 to determine the winner of the 2019 Cricket World Cup. It was contested by the runners-up from the previous tournament, New Zealand, and the host nation, England. It was the fifth time Lord's had hosted the Cricket World Cup Final, the most of any ground.

                The two teams were tied on 241 runs at the end of the match, resulting in a Super Over being played to break the tie. On the final ball of New Zealand's Super Over, after equalling the 15 runs England managed in their over, Martin Guptill attempted to score the winning run but was run out by Jason Roy and Jos Buttler, meaning the Super Over was also tied. England won on the boundary count-back rule, having scored 26 boundaries to New Zealand's 17, thus becoming Cricket World Cup winners for the first time.

With 14 teams battling it out for cricket's ultimate prize, the tournament provided fans with a rollercoaster ride of emotions and culminated in a memorable final between the host nations.

                from 14 February to 29 March 2015, and was won by Australia, defeating New Zealand by 7 wickets in the final. This was the second time the tournament was held in Australia and New Zealand, the first having been the 1992 Cricket World Cup. India were the defending champions having won the previous edition in 2011, but they were eliminated by eventual champions Australia in the semi-finals.

                The tournament consisted of 14 teams, which were split into two pools of seven, with each team playing every other team in their pool once. The top four teams from each pool progressed to the knockout stage, which consisted of quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final.
                
                The final was between the co-hosts Australia and New Zealand. Australia won by seven wickets, to win their fifth Cricket World Cup.
